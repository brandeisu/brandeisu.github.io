					<p class="petition-body bg-brandeis-white left-align pad-t-10 pad-b-10 pad-l-10 pad-r-10 margin-t-0">This evening the Brandeis administration held an open meeting to hear the voices of Brandeis students, faculty and staff about Free Speech and Free Expression on campus. There will be two more meetings. One on Monday Oct. 2nd from 12pm-1:15pm and another Monday Oct. 30th from 5:30pm-6:45pm.

Please read the attached principles the Free Expression Task force has drawn up and consider going to one of the meetings. Your voice can only be heard if you speak up.

DRAFT PRINCIPLES OF FREE SPEECH AND FREE EXPRESSION

In November 2016, President Ronald D. Liebowitz convened the Presidential Task Force on Free Expression “to reflect on and re-examine our university’s policies and practices related to academic freedom and free expression.” The task force was charged with drafting a set of principles to guide “free and robust debate and deliberation among all members of the university community.” The task force has studied Brandeis’ history regarding free expression and academic freedom, reviewed other universities’ statements and practices, and engaged in conversations with a wide range of campus constituencies.

These conversations challenged us to achieve a common understanding of what free expression means on campus. As we struggled to grasp, if not always reconcile, the widely divergent opinions we heard, the task force took inspiration from the Brandeis mission statement: “By being a nonsectarian university that welcomes students, teachers and staff of every nationality, religion and orientation, Brandeis renews the American heritage of cultural diversity, equal access to opportunity and freedom of expression.” Equally, we drew inspiration from our diversity statement: Brandeis “believes that diverse backgrounds and ideas are crucial to academic excellence; recognizes the need to analyze and address the ways in which social, cultural and economic inequalities affect power and privilege in the larger society and at Brandeis itself; and honors freedom of expression and civility of discourse as fundamental educational cornerstones.”

Brandeis affirms the principle of free speech and free expression on campus. This freedom should be accessible to all members of a diverse community. Genuine higher learning is possible only where free, reasoned, and civil speech and discussion are respected. This committee seeks to find a common ground by proposing principles that allow even difficult conversations to take place.

1. Maximizing Free Speech in a Diverse Community

All members of Brandeis should be able to put forth ideas for consideration, engagement and criticism by others, as such exchanges are core to the mission of institutions of higher learning. We explicitly connect free speech concerns with our desire for a diverse, inclusive community. Free expression, including in the arts, implies the free exchange of ideas — talking and listening. We endorse as a principle for action Louis Brandeis’ remark: “If there be a time to expose through discussion the falsehood and fallacies, to avert the evil by the processes of education, the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence.” The university has a responsibility to encourage the airing of the widest range of political and scholarly opinions, and to prevent attempts to shut down conversations, no matter what their topic.

2. Developing Skills to Engage in Difficult Conversations

The Brandeis community rightly prides itself on debating difficult issues vigorously. To introduce prior restraint by attempting to define realms of prohibited speech would be for the administration to produce a chilling effect upon speech and the exchange of views on campus. Reaching our fullest potential in this regard will entail an ongoing educational process, a curriculum that exposes students and the entire community to various viewpoints, and a long institutional memory about how free expression operates and has operated at Brandeis. All this will require the intellectual courage to risk discomfort for the sake of greater understanding.

3. Sharing Responsibility

All members of the Brandeis community bear the moral responsibility for their actions and the impact those actions have on the community. Open-minded disagreement can be a marker of respect, the sort of response for which we strive. We should embrace civility, but in the larger sense: An issue can be engaged with emotion, and even a raised voice, if the humanity of all involved is respected. We should work toward a campus life that promotes the expression of a diverse set of intellectual, political, cultural and social outlooks. The university’s commitment to freedom of expression is an essential part of the ethical and intellectual imperative to strive for diversity and inclusion on campus. The university must find ways to engage the whole community about each person’s responsibility to foster a just and inclusive campus culture so that all can participate fully in the intellectual and social life of the university.

4. Rejecting Physical Violence

Peaceful protest is fully appropriate in an environment of vigorous discussion and debate, but physical violence of any kind or the prevention of speech is unacceptable. Once violence is normalized as an ingredient of free expression, it sets the pattern, ending rather than supporting free expression.

5. Distinguishing Between Invited Speakers and University Honorees

Brandeis should provide space for campus organizations of all sorts, including invitations to outside speakers: Such openness does not constitute a university endorsement of the organizations or the speakers. However, there are certain circumstances, especially the granting of honorary degrees, in which an invitation issued by the university does constitute an endorsement of some major aspect of someone's life or work. A protest against the university for making a disfavored choice for a prestigious honor is not, in itself, an attack on free speech.

					<p class="petition-body bg-brandeis-white left-align pad-t-10 pad-b-10 pad-l-10 pad-r-10 margin-t-0">Today, the Student Union Website got a much needed refresh, and changed its domain, from union.brandeis.edu to union.brandeis.io.

Accompanying some slight visual changes were some new features, including:

- Editing capabilities without any knowledge of code, via a custom content management system, via a cloud based backend. In other words, now any member of the student union can edit the website, and a log of all changes made is publicly available. 

- Petitions!  If you have an idea or request, you now have a place to express your opinions and goals for Brandeis. 

- A simpler place for News, including a simplified format.

- Screen-reader accessibility.  The site is now compliant to ADA website standards.

- Groups: See all of the groups in the Student Union, and who is in what group!

Lots has changed, but much has stayed the same.  The Union is still here to serve you, and will do whatever it takes to make your experience at Brandeis superb, and your voices at Brandeis heard.</p>
